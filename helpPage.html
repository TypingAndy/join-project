      <div class="h2Help">What is Join</div>
      <br />
      <div>
        <span class="helpPageBlueJoin">Join</span> is a kanban-based project
        management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as
        part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.

        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
        method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
        efficiency (or flow).
        <span class="helpPageBlueJoin">Join</span> leverages the principles of
        kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive,
        visual interface.

            <div>
              When you log in to <span class="helpPageBlueJoin">Join</span>,
              you'll find a default board. This board represents your project
              and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await
              feedback” and "Done".

            <div class="h3Help">Creating Contacts</div>
            In <span class="helpPageBlueJoin">Join</span>, you can add contacts
            to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click
            on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added,
            these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the
            tasks on the board.

            <div class="h3Help">Adding Cards</div>
            Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
            Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
            appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
            the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.

          <div>
            <div class="h3Help">Moving Cards</div>
            As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on
            the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to
            another.

            <div class="h3Help">Deleting Cards</div>
            Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list
            or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the
            board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action
            is irreversible.
